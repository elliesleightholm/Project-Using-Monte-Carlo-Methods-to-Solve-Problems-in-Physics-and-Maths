First draft of the first semester short report. All files (including LaTeX and pdf) are named 'Cover Page' - this can be ignored; it includes a cover page but the documents are still the final report. 

The report covers Monte Carlo approaches to solve problems in physics and mathematics, specifically statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. It covers the Boltzmann distribution, the Metropolis Algorithm and the Ising Model.
