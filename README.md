# Project-Using-Monte-Carlo-Methods-to-Solve-Problems-in-Physics-and-Maths
All code from my final year project, 'Using Random Numbers to Solve Problems in Physics and Maths'. Specifically, Monte Carlo methods. This year I will have the opportunity to explore the simulation of galaxy cluster formations and atmosphere re-entry simulation.
